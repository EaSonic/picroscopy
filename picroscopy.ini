[picroscopy]

; Specifies the interface and port to listen for requests. The interface is
; specified as an address, and 0.0.0.0 can be used for "all interfaces".
; Defaults to 0.0.0.0:80
#listen=0.0.0.0:80

; Specifies clients that the server will accept requests from. This is
; given as a CIDR network. Defaults to 0.0.0.0/0
#clients=0.0.0.0/0

; These settings specify the location that Picroscopy will use to store images
; and thumbnails captured by the library. The directories for images and
; thumbnails *MUST* be different. If the directories do not exist they will be
; created at application startup. Defaults to temporary directories created
; under /tmp.
#images_dir=/tmp/picroscopy/images
#thumbs_dir=/tmp/picroscopy/thumbs

; Specify the size of thumbnails generated by Picroscopy as WIDTHxHEIGHT.
; Defaults to 320x320.
#thumbs_size=320x320

; Set this to the path of your sendmail binary (if you haven't got one
; installed, Postfix is a good choice). If you don't wish to use a sendmail
; binary, see the smtp_server value below. Defaults to /usr/sbin/sendmail.
#sendmail=/usr/sbin/sendmail

; If you set this value, e-mail will be sent directly via the specified SMTP
; server rather than using the sendmail binary above. Generally speaking,
; sendmail is preferable as it gracefully handles the case where the remote
; SMTP server is unavailable. No default value.
#smtp_server=

; The email_from setting specifies the e-mail address that picroscopy will
; send e-mail from. If host is omitted, the sendmail binary typically uses the
; machine's hostname. Defaults to picroscopy.
#email_from=picroscopy
