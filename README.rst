picroscopy
==========

picroscopy is a small Python web-application which is intended for usage with
a RaspberryPi as a microscopy solution. With the PiCam mounted on a microscope,
the RaspberryPi provides a live video feed to its monitor via HDMI, while
another machine can be used to control the setup via a web-based interface.

The project is written in `Python`_ 3 and is open-sourced under the `GPL
license`_.  The `source code`_ can be obtained from GitHub. The
`documentation`_ can be read on ReadTheDocs.
