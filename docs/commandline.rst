Command Line Reference
======================

The picroscopy application launches a live view of the Raspberry Pi's camera
and serves a web application providing control of the camera. Various options
can be used to configure which network clients can access the web application,
and the paths which the camera will use when writing images.

Description
===========

.. program:: picroscopy

.. option:: -h, --help

    Show the application's help page, giving a brief description of each
    command line option, and exit.

.. option:: --version

    Show the program's version number and exit.

.. option:: -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG

    Specify the configuration file that the application should load. See the
    :ref:`configuration` section for more information on the configuration file
    format.

.. option:: -q, --quiet

    Produce less console output. When this is specified, only error messages
    will be visible at the console. By default, warnings and error messages
    are displayed.

.. option:: -v, --verbose

    Produce more console output. When this is specified, information, warning,
    and error messages will be visible at the console. By default, warnings
    and error messages are displayed.

.. option:: -l FILE, --log-file FILE

    Log displayed messages to the specified FILE. The log file will be appended
    to if it already exists. Its format will include the timestamp that the
    message was displayed, and the severity of the message.

.. option:: -P, --pdb

    Run under `PuDB`_ (if available) or PDB. This launches Picroscopy within a
    Python debugger for development purposes.

.. option:: -L HOST[:PORT], --listen HOST[:PORT]

    The address and port of the interface that Picroscopy will listen on.
    Defaults to ``0.0.0.0:80`` (when running as root) or ``0.0.0.0:8000`` (when
    running as a non-root user). The ``0.0.0.0`` address means "listen on all
    available network interfaces".

.. option:: -C NETWORK[/LEN], --clients NETWORK[/LEN]

    The network that clients must belong to. Clients that do not belong to the
    specified network will be denied access to Picroscopy. Defaults to
    ``0.0.0.0/0`` (all valid addresses).

.. option:: --images-dir DIR

    The directory in which Picroscopy will store images captured by the camera.
    If not specified, defaults to a temporary directory which is destroyed
    upon exit. If the specified directory does not exist, it will be created.

.. option:: --thumbs-dir DIR

    The directory in which Picroscopy will store thumbnails generated from the
    images taken by the camera. If not specified, defaults to a temporary
    directory which is destroyed upon exit. If the specified directory does
    not exist, it will be created. The thumbnails directory *must* be different
    to the images directory.

.. option:: --thumbs-size WIDTHxHEIGHT

    The maximum size for generated thumbnails (the actual size may be smaller
    due to aspect ratio preservation). Defaults to 320x320.

.. option:: --email-from USER[@HOST]

    The address which Picroscopy will use as a From: address when sending
    e-mail. If HOST is not specified, the configuration of the sending SMTP
    server will determine the host associated with the USER.

.. option:: --sendmail EXEC

    Use the specified sendmail binary to send e-mail. This is the preferred
    option for sending e-mail as it (usually) gracefully handles the case where
    the target SMTP server is unavailable. Defaults to ``/usr/sbin/sendmail``.

.. option:: --smtp-server HOST[:PORT]

    Use the specified SMTP smarthost to send e-mail. This should only be used
    if you do not wish to configure a local sendmail binary. If this option
    is specified, it will always override any ``--sendmail`` specification.


Examples
========

Run Picroscopy, with the default configuration and verbose logging::

    $ picroscopy -v

Run Picroscopy, listening for clients on port 8080 of the interface with the
address ``192.168.0.5``, and only accepting requests from the machine with
IP address ``192.168.0.6``::

    $ picroscopy -L 192.168.0.5:8080 -C 192.168.0.6

Run Picroscopy, only accepting requests from the ``192.168.0.0`` private
network::

    $ picroscopy -C 192.168.0.0/16

Run Picroscopy, ensuring that e-mail is sent via the SMTP server running on
``localhost``, and that e-mail appears to come from ``noreply@example.com``::

    $ picroscopy --smtp-server localhost --email-from noreply@example.com

Run Picroscopy, explicitly specifying the images directory and the thumbnails
directory (which ensures both persist across runs; the default is to use
ephemeral temporary directories)::

    $ mkdir -p picroscopy/images picroscopy/thumbs
    $ picroscopy --images-dir picroscopy/images --thumbs-dir picroscopy/thumbs
